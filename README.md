# SDTP
**Disclaimer and warning:** SDTP is in a very early state of development. There is no stable release and it currently does not satisfy the strict requirements for review and testing of cryptographic software.

A project that intents to implement cryptographic and steganographic concepts, especially those beyond ordinary encryption and authentication.

My first effort in that regard is the development of hcommit (hash commit) a library that creates and verifies cryptographic commitments. This will be followed by a command-line (and possibly GUI) tool to manage these, while the library can also be used in situations where it is otherwise suitable (fair random numbers, secure multiparty computation).
